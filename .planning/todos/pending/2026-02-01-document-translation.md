## Problem

Users need the ability to translate document content into multiple languages. This is different from app localization (UI language) - this is about translating the actual document text the user has written.

Use cases:
- Author writes in English, needs Spanish/French/German versions
- Translate technical documentation for international teams
- Create multilingual versions of marketing content

## Solution

TBD - Consider:
1. AI-powered translation integration (OpenAI, DeepL, Google Translate API)
2. Translation panel in sidebar showing original + translated text
3. Export translated versions as separate documents
4. Inline translation mode (replace text in-place)
5. Translation memory/glossary for consistent terminology
6. Support for RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew) - ties into RTL management todo
