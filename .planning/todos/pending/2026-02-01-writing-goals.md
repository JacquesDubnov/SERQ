## Problem

User wants ability to set and track writing goals (daily word counts, deadlines, targets).

## Solution

- Daily/weekly/monthly word count targets
- Document-level word count goals
- Deadline tracking
- Progress visualization (charts, streaks)
- Notifications/reminders (optional)
- Achievement system (writing streaks, milestones)
- NaNoWriMo-style tracking mode
