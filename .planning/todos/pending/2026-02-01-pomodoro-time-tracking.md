## Problem

Writers often benefit from focused work sessions with structured breaks. A Pomodoro-style timer would help users:
- Maintain focus during writing sessions (typically 25-minute blocks)
- Take regular breaks to avoid burnout
- Track writing sessions over time
- Build consistent writing habits

This fits SERQ's philosophy of supporting the writer's workflow, not just the document.

## Solution

TBD - Research needed for:
- UI placement (status bar? floating widget? focus mode integration?)
- Timer configuration (classic 25/5 vs customizable)
- Session history/stats (SQLite storage like version history?)
- Notifications (system notifications? in-app alerts?)
- Integration with focus mode
- Sound/visual cues for transitions
