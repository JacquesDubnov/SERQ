## Problem

SERQ needs consistent logo/branding incorporated throughout the app:
- App icon (already done via Tauri config)
- In-app logo placement (header? sidebar?)
- Splash screen (separate todo)
- About dialog

## Solution

TBD - Need to determine:
- Logo placement strategy (subtle vs prominent)
- Where logo appears (header left, about dialog, etc.)
- Logo variants needed (icon only, full wordmark, etc.)
- Light/dark mode variants
