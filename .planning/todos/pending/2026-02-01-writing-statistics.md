## Problem

User wants detailed writing statistics beyond basic word count.

## Solution

- Reading time estimate
- Readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid, etc.)
- Sentence/paragraph length distribution
- Character frequency
- Writing session tracking (words per session, time spent)
- Historical trends (words written per day/week)
- Export statistics as report
