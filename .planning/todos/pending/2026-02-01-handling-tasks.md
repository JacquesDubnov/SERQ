## Problem

User wants task management capabilities within documents - ability to create, track, and manage tasks.

## Solution

- Task list extension with checkable items
- Task panel showing all tasks across document
- Due dates, priorities, categories
- Progress tracking (completed/total)
- Consider: standalone task view vs inline task blocks
